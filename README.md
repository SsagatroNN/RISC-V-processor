# README Team 30
This CPU was designed as part of Imperial College London's Term 1 coursework for the Instruction and Computer Architecture module. I led a team of 4 members including myself to complete the CPU.
## Description of CPU and Achievement
You will find in the repository our Single Cycle and Pipelined RISC-V CPUs.

Our approach as a team was to split each stage into features. Each feature is assigned a branch where the person delegated that feature can work as they wish. Upon completion, we decided that a meeting should be set to merge that branch into another relevant branch. If unavailable to meet, we, conventionally, make a pull request for other team members to view the changes.

Adding to the base processor called for efficient communication between team members. Upon meeting multiple times, the team has reached a consensus with regard to how every instruction would be implemented. This allowed for a standard that the team had to meet when implementing anything in the CPU, limiting clashes and future issues. This indeed worked for us.

Thanks to Git and GitHub, we managed to share our work, fix other's work, and plan effectively, allowing us to build the CPU in a coordinated, and effective manner.
